Useful programs
	- SSL client:
		- openssl s_client
		- stunnel with local listener
		- ? gnutls
	- SSL server
		- openssl s_server
		- stunnel to netcat (nc)
		- ? gnutls
	- Arbitrary server
		- netcat (standalone)
		- netcat (busybox)
		- tcpsvd (busybox)
	- Arbitrary client
		- bash, if tcp support compiled in (rare) [/dev/tcp/IP/port]
		- netcat (nc) - standalone
		- netcat (nc) - busybox
		- socat, too
	 - Byte handling
        - native is 5x - 11x faster using a case statement
	 	- od (busybox / standalone)
		- hexdump (busybox / standalone)
		- read -r <number of characters> in bash

Bit Math in Bash
	- support for most bit-like operations is present, although ~ for creating inverse bit masks isn't
	- right-shift is implemented
	- bytes => integers is a puzzle - we might be able to use OD, or we might be able to use a case statement (with 256 cases) or an array (with 256 entries)
	- two bytes read are needed (eg for UTF-8 string lengths)

- mqtt in busybox ?
