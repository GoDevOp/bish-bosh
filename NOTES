Major TODO
- password can contain embedded ASCII NUL
- password should be loadable from a file separate to anything else, so allowing production deployments
- UNSUBSCRIBE / UNSUBACK is not implemented to record subscription state
- PING request / response using a timer (SECONDS) is not implemented
  - best done for shells which support 'SECONDS'
  - if not, refuse to allow a keep-alive which is non-zero
  - need to reject keep alives below about 5 seconds, as we'll not be able to satisfy them
- Need a simple way to send messages from disk on start
- Need to automatically re-subscribe on start
- Need to support connecting more than once (ie connection recycling) so that we can script clean-session resets
- Clean Session = 1 should delete all saved state on start
- bash backend: exec 3<>/dev/tcp/"$bishbosh_server"/"$bishbosh_port"

Ideas
- byobu vs tmux vs screen for multiple viewing (or support all 3 in a complex manner [byobu requires newt])
- newt (whiptail) vs dialog: both in Centos 6.4 default, ? only whiptail in Ubuntu minimal
- auth backends - ldap, ?pam, local users file
- generic SOCKS handling via tsocks or proxychains-ng
- .netrc for proxy password details?
- .curlrc for proxy details?
- .wgetrc for proxy details?
- proxy env variables (originated in wget)
  - typical values are http_proxy=https://USER@PASSWORD:ADDRESS:PORT/
  - would need to parse no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com" and https_proxy, too.
